# Environments

- [Level-based Foraging](www.github.com/semitable/lb-foraging) -  mixed cooperative-competitive game, which focuses on the coordination of the agents involved.
- [Multi-Robot Warehouse](www.github.com/semitable/robotic-warehouse) - A simulated warehouse with robots moving and delivering requested goods.
- [StarCraft Multi-agent Challenge](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac) - A decentralised micromanagement scenarios built on StarCraft II.
- [Multi-agent Particle Environment](https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs) - A diverse set of 2D tasks involving cooperation and competition between agents.
- [Malmö](https://github.com/microsoft/malmo) - An environment built on top of Minecraft. Also see [MarLÖ](https://github.com/crowdAI/marLo) (short for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in MalmÖ).
- [Derk's Gym](https://gym.derkgame.com/) - A MOBA-style multi-agent competitive team-based game.
- [Flatland](https://flatland.aicrowd.com/) - Based on a real-world problem of coordinating a railway traffic infrastructure.
- [Neural-MMO](https://jsuarez5341.github.io/) - A massively multiagent game environment for training and evaluating intelligent agents.

# Algorithm Implementations
- [PyMARL](https://github.com/oxwhirl/pymarl) - WhiRL's framework for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning and includes implementations of QMIX, COMA, VDN, IQL, and QTRAN (only cooperative MARL).
- [Extended-PyMARL](https://github.com/uoe-agents/epymarl) - An extension of the above, with the addition of IA2C, IPPO, MADDPG, MAA2C and MAPPO. Also improves the consistency of the implementations for fair comparisons.
